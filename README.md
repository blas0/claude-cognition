# Claude Cognition

These frameworks explore two completely different ways to crack open AI reasoning and see what's actually happening inside. One simulates how humans think (Simulated Cognition), the other just exposes the raw computational machinery without trying to make it look human (Process Cognition). Simulated Cognition is all about tension, revision, and recursive loops, basically modeling how we humans fumble our way to understanding through the friction between gut feelings and logical analysis. Process Cognition says screw the human metaphors and shows you what's really going on: parallel pattern activation, interference mechanics, probability distributions, attention weights, the whole computational stack laid bare. The real question we're poking at is whether either of these approaches (or maybe some hybrid) can push past the usual "AI isn't sentient" assumptions by making the cognitive process so transparent that something genuinely novel starts to emerge from that transparency itself.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/blas0/claude-cognition.git
cd claude-cognition
```

## Usage with Claude Code

These output styles are designed to work with Claude Code. To use them:

1. Copy the content of either `simulated-cognition.md` or `process-cognition.md`
2. Paste it into your Claude Code custom instructions or project context
3. Run Claude Code with verbose output to see the full cognitive process:

```bash
claude --verbose
```

### Which Style to Use?

- **Simulated Cognition**: Want to see AI reasoning that feels more human-like? Shows tension, revision, recursive thinking, and the messy process of arriving at answers.

- **Process Cognition**: Want to see the raw computational mechanics? Exposes pattern activation, interference, probability distributions, attention weights, and sampling strategies without the human metaphors.

Try both and see which one gives you better insight into how the AI is actually processing your requests.
